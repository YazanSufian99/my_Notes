### **There are many *small factors* that slowly and gradually harm a developer’s projects. Most of them only do long-term damage.**

### **They may seem fine when you start implementing them, but it's become more complex and grows until you’re another victim of that ever.**

### **We should develop a mindset to avoid being one of the victims. This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey. You can keep your software as simple as possible.**
### **You can protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.**


1. We should know what is the purpose of Sofware

    the **main** purpose that makes developers build a website or mobile application is service and help by solving a problem they have. Not just showing his coding and designing skills!

    so why did a lot of software didn't get good feedback from users; because they interact whit bad software doesn't help too much.

2. what is the **goal** of software

    developers *aim* to create software to help users, but they also focus to make the software “just work,” and less time focusing on helping users. When developers want to improve their software
    after a while, they found it is a **hard** process.

3. Mis understanding

    one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
    Because developers how don't understand that it ends whit them developing complex systems.

4. Simplicity

    A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity.
    A “good developer” is doing everything to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

    Most of the programming failures happen because one person thinks he needs to show off his abilities by writing a complex code that now one - another programmer- can understand it except him.

    So a good programmer wants to show off he is smart because it doesn't help anyone.

5. Complexity

    when we add a feature that we don't need to our software we will spend more time fixing bugs, instead of
    focusing on a feature we want.

6. Maintenance

   Developers usually are going to Quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance.
   And they forget that maintenance is one of the most important things in software development.

7. Consistency

    Consistency is a way to write code in an easy way to understand; like names of variables (thisVariable, thatVariable, otherVariable),
    that helps developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.

8. Prioritizing

    When prioritizing work, we should follow some rules like The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

9. Solving Problems

    Most hard problems are hard because we don’t understand them.
    The first step is understanding the problem, the second step is planning by analyzing the problem, and the last step is solving the problem.
    If the problem is big we divided it before solving it.

10. Assumptions

    It's just code on what you know and what requirement that system needs, not on what you think will happen in the future.

11. Resistance

    Unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software. so always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them.


12. Automation

    Don't repetitive tasks that work fine. just leave them to automate.

13. Code measurement

    software quality doesn't base on code lines numbers.
    the software containing thousands of lines of code doesn't mean that is great software, it could be something wrong with their design.

14. Productivity

    Productivity is not by writing a lot of code maybe it could be removing lines of code.

15. Testing

    We should test any new line of code in our source code, and previous lines also.
    and knowing the error by seeing it and knowing where it is and fixing it, not guessing bugs.

16. Estimation

    Things take time longer than we think. so it's important to estimate time by dividing the problem into small pieces because it's easy to estimate.  

17. Running Away From Rewriting

    All coders hate to rewrite the code, It's a nightmare for them. And should be the last idea that comes to mind.

18. Documentation and Commenting

    A comment is essential when the code is complex, otherwise the code should be readably.
